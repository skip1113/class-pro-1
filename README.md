USER STORIES:

1) Audience: people who like to hike and drink beer
2) Helps people plan their hikes around favorite breweries or restaurants.
3) Geographically connect hiking trails to brewery locations:
    -provide trail directions to trail heads
    -directions to brewery venues
    -trail and brewery ratings
    -difficulty levels
4) Essential User Stories:  As a developer I want to provide...
    a) A website where you can search for hiking and breweries at the same time.
    b) I want to provide menu or beer ratings.
    c) I want to provide difficulty levels for hiking trails
    d) Provide hiking ratings or reviews.
    e) Route planner (bar hopping)
    f) Show maps or provide directions
    g) As a user I want to be able to plan my hiking adventures with one app -- with ease!
